YearUp2025 Capstones/Test
This project is a Financial Tracker application that helps users manage their financial transactions. The application allows users to track deposits, payments, and generate detailed reports based on transaction history. It stores transaction data in a CSV file and provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the system. I also include Characters from my favorite show to give the application a bit of an uplifting spirit.
